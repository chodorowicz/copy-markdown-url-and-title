# Copy Markdown URL and Title

- This script is written in using JavaScript automation for macOS. 
- It copies URL and title from the current browser in a markdown format - `[Title of Page](https://url.of.page.com)`. 
- It has [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) specific metadata, but you can use it in any application or context where JavaScript automation is supported.

## Currently supported browsers:
- Chromium based browsers
  - Google Chrome,
  - Chromium,
  - Brave Browser,
  - Opera,
  - Vivaldi,
  - Microsoft Edge
- Safari
- Firefox
  - Firefox integration is the *worst* since Firefox doesn't support direct AppleScript automation, and the script uses System Events and keystrokes in its case.
