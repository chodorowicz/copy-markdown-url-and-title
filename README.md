# Copy Markdown URL and Title

This script is written in AppleScript copies URL and title from the current browser in a markdown format - `[Title of Page](https://url.of.page.com)`. It has [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) specific metadata, but you can use it in any application or context where AppleScript is supported.

Currently, supported browsers are Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, Brave Browser, Opera and Vivaldi. Firefox integration is the *worst* since Firefox doesn't support direct AppleScript automation, and the script uses System Events and keystrokes in its case.
